# A Deep Dive into OpenVAS: Enhancing Your Network's Security Through Effective Vulnerability Scanning and Risk Mitigation

This repository contains a research paper concentrated on the implementation and analysis of OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) as a vulnerability scanning and risk mitigation tool within a corporate network. The project showcases the practical application of OpenVAS, highlighting its capabilities in identifying vulnerabilities, providing insights for remediation, and enhancing overall network security.

## Description

OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanner designed to detect security weaknesses across networks, servers, and applications. By deploying OpenVAS in a real-world corporate environment, this project evaluates its effectiveness in identifying security flaws and offers actionable recommendations to improve the security posture of an organization's infrastructure.

The project includes:
- **Implementation details**: Step-by-step deployment and configuration of OpenVAS.
- **Scan types**: Full and fast scans, authenticated scans, and CVE-based scans to detect a wide range of vulnerabilities.
- **Reports and findings**: Generated reports that provide an overview of vulnerabilities found and recommended remediation actions.
- **Automation**: Setup of scheduled scans to run daily, with email alerts for detected vulnerabilities.

The implementation is particularly valuable for understanding how OpenVAS can be used in live, enterprise environments and demonstrates its potential as a cost-effective tool for continuous network security monitoring.

## Key Features
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports with actionable insights and recommendations.
- **Automated Scanning**: Configured for daily scans with email alerts for vulnerability detections.
- **Real-world Application**: Demonstrates OpenVAS's effectiveness within an actual corporate network environment.

## Purpose

This project is designed to:
- Demonstrate the practical use of OpenVAS in enhancing network security.
- Provide an in-depth guide on how to implement and configure OpenVAS.
- Offer real-world insights into the vulnerabilities that OpenVAS can detect and mitigate.
